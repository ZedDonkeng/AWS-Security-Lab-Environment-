**KMS Key Policy (Resource-based):**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowS3Service",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "kms:ViaService": "s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowApplicationAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:role/MyApplicationRole"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**IAM Policy for Application Role:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-prod-encrypted-bucket/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:ACCOUNT-ID:key/KEY-ID",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "kms:ViaService": "s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 4: Advanced CloudTrail Configuration

   - Click "Upload" ‚Üí "Add files"
   - Select your file

2. **Verify Encryption Settings**
   - In "Properties" section during upload
   - "Server-side encryption" should show "Override bucket settings"
   - Verify KMS key is selected: `prod-s3-encryption`
   - Add metadata tags if needed

3. **Monitor Upload**
   - After upload, select the object
   - In "Properties" tab, verify encryption details
   - Check "Server-side encryption" shows KMS key information

4. **Test Access**
   - Download the file to verify decryption works
   - Check CloudTrail for logged events (may take 5-15 minutes)

## üîß Console-Based Operations

### Monitoring Encryption Status

   - Go to "Properties" tab
   - Check "Server-side encryption" details
   - Verify KMS key ID and encryption algorithm

3. **Review CloudTrail Events**
   - Go to CloudTrail Console
   - Click "Event history"
   - Filter by:
     - Event source: `s3.amazonaws.com`
     - Resource name: Your bucket name
   - Look for events like `PutObject`, `GetObject`

### Access Control Verification

1. **Test IAM Permissions**
   - Switch to different IAM user/role
   - Try to access encrypted objects
   - Verify access denied without KMS permissions

2. **Review S3 Access Logs**
   - Navigate to your access logs bucket
   - Download and review log files
   - Look for access patterns and potential issues

### Cost Optimization Checks

1. **Monitor KMS Usage**

   - Navigate to "Metrics" ‚Üí "KMS"
   - Check "NumberOfRequestsSucceeded" metric
   - Compare costs with and without Bucket Key

2. **Review Storage Classes**
   - In S3 bucket, check object storage classes
   - Verify lifecycle rules are working
   - Monitor transition to cheaper storage tiers

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Encryption Strategy
- **Use customer-managed KMS keys** for production workloads
- **Enable automatic key rotation** for compliance requirements
- **Implement least-privilege IAM policies** with condition keys
- **Use S3 Bucket Keys** to reduce KMS costs for high-volume workloads

### Access Control
- **Implement MFA delete** for critical buckets
- **Use VPC endpoints** for private network access
- **Enable S3 Block Public Access** at account level
- **Implement resource-based policies** for fine-grained control

### Monitoring and Compliance
- **Enable CloudTrail data events** for all sensitive buckets
- **Set up CloudWatch alarms** for unusual access patterns
- **Use AWS Config** for compliance monitoring
- **Implement S3 Access Analyzer** for access review

## üéØ Performance Optimization

### S3 Bucket Key Benefits
- Reduces KMS API calls by up to 99%
- Significantly lowers encryption costs
- Maintains same security posture
- Enabled per-bucket or per-object

### Multipart Upload with Encryption
```bash
# Initiate multipart upload with encryption
aws s3api create-multipart-upload \
    --bucket my-prod-encrypted-bucket \
    --key large-file.dat \
    --server-side-encryption aws:kms \
    --ssekms-key-id alias/prod-s3-encryption
```

## üìä Cost Optimization

### KMS Cost Considerations

1. **Monitor KMS Usage**
   - Go to AWS Cost Explorer
   - Filter by service: "Key Management Service"
   - Review monthly KMS API call costs
   - Compare periods before/after enabling Bucket Key

2. **Check S3 Storage Classes**
   - In S3 bucket ‚Üí "Metrics" tab
   - Review storage class analysis
   - Verify lifecycle rule effectiveness
   - Monitor transition patterns to cheaper tiers

3. **Review CloudWatch KMS Metrics**
   - Go to CloudWatch Console
   - Navigate to "Metrics" ‚Üí "KMS"
   - Check "NumberOfRequestsSucceeded"
   - Set up cost alerts for unusual spikes
