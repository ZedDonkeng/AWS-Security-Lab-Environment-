# 🔐 AWS Cloud Security Architecture & Implementation

This repository outlines how I approach securing AWS environments using native security services, secure cloud design principles, infrastructure as code (IaC), and container security best practices.

## ✅ AWS Security Services

### 🔑 Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Enforce **least privilege** using fine-grained IAM roles and policies.
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
- Use **IAM Access Analyzer** for policy validation and external access detection.
- Avoid long-term access keys in favor of temporary credentials via roles.

### 📜 AWS CloudTrail
- Capture and store all API calls across the account in **S3** with encryption.
- Enable **multi-region trails** and **CloudTrail Insights** for anomaly detection.
- Forward logs to **CloudWatch Logs** and use **Athena** for ad-hoc queries.

### 🛡️ Amazon GuardDuty
- Continuously monitor for threats like port scanning, suspicious API activity, and compromised credentials.
- Integrate findings into **AWS Security Hub** and trigger remediation workflows via **EventBridge** and **Lambda**.

### 📘 AWS Config
- Continuously assess resource configurations against custom and managed rules.
- Track all configuration changes and store history in **S3**.
- Automate compliance alerts and remediation.

### 🧭 AWS Security Hub
- Centralize security findings from:
  - GuardDuty, Config, IAM Access Analyzer
  - Third-party tools (e.g., Tenable, CrowdStrike)
- Evaluate environments against **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark**.
- Integrate with SIEM and ticketing platforms for incident tracking.

## 🏗️ Cloud Architecture & Security Design

- Implement **multi-tier VPC architecture** (public/private subnets, NAT Gateways, route tables).
- Secure **EC2 and ALB** using **Security Groups** and **NACLs**.
- Use **AWS WAF + Shield** for web application DDoS and OWASP Top 10 protection.
- Encrypt data **at rest** with **KMS** and **in transit** with TLS.
- Use **VPC Flow Logs**, **CloudWatch**, and **CloudTrail** for deep visibility.

## 🧩 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Tools:
- **Terraform** for multi-cloud IaC.
- **AWS CloudFormation** for AWS-native stacks.

### Security Implementation:
- Predefined modules that:
  - Enforce encryption (EBS, RDS, S3).
  - Apply IAM least privilege roles.
  - Configure secure Security Group rules.
  - Enable logging (S3 access logs, ALB logs, VPC Flow Logs).

- IaC is integrated into CI/CD pipelines for:
  - Code review.
  - Policy validation (e.g., using `tfsec`, `checkov`).
  - Deployment into secure, version-controlled environments.

## 📦 Container Security (ECS & EKS)

### 🐳 Amazon ECS (Fargate & EC2 launch types)
- Assign **task-level IAM roles** for scoped permissions.
- Use **ECR** with image scanning and lifecycle policies.
- Monitor containers with **CloudWatch Logs** and **Container Insights**.

### ☸️ Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- Use **IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)** to secure pod access.
- Define **Kubernetes RBAC** and **network policies** for segmentation.
- Enable **audit logging**, **KMS encryption**, and **Pod Security Standards**.
- Implement **image scanning**, secrets management, and autoscaling.

## 📌 Summary

This security-first approach helps maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability across AWS workloads by:
- Leveraging native security services.
- Designing secure and scalable architectures.
- Automating best practices using IaC.
- Hardening containerized applications.
